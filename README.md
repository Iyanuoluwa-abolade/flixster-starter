### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

Yes, the topics prepared me to complete the assignment. The class on using APIs made deploying the movies very easy. The only features I felt unprepared to complete were the 'Sort By' and 'Side Bar'. However, I was able to learn them and implement them in my code.

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
If I had more time, I would have added a list of genres by which the movies could be filtered.

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

This project was much better than the last one, and I feel that I was able to improve my skills. The classes really helped a lot. 

One of my peers used a color-changing design for the styling of the website, and I would love to try it next time.
